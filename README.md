# Breakout Game #
	
This is my version of the breakout game that can be created by following [MDN’s tutorial](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Games/Tutorials/2D_Breakout_game_pure_JavaScript).


I have improved upon the [original game](http://breakout.enclavegames.com/lesson10.html) by:

* Making the ball collide with the edges of the bricks and paddle rather than the center
* Making the ball color change between red, green, and blue upon brick collision
* Making the bricks able to survive more than one collision, and change color based on the number of times they’ve been hit
* Allowing the ball to change its x velocity when it hits the side of a brick
* Adding the auto-play feature for automated testing
